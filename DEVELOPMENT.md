# CS 225 Final Project Development Document
## Week 1 (11/22/2020 ~ 11/28/2020)
The team produced a skeletal structure for many of the project's major components, as well as came up with design decisions for 
many of the classes that are necessary to implement (the graph and algorithms classes in particular). The team has setup the very
basics for creating test suites and also implemented a make file to ensure that all components are functioning properly
and will continue to function properly on the EWS environment. The team has also researched into many of the algorithms that
are planned to be used including Dijkstra's Shortest Path, Page-Rank, and Graph Breadth-First Search algorithms which are
critical for the project's success. A barebones Github scrumboard has also been created to help with work flow, as well as with
maintaining coordination between team members; the scrumboard will be further fleshed out as more
bugs and issues are discovered. Finally, Now that the foundation has been laid down, the team will be able to start developing more 
particular and detailed functionality for the project classes, and given the current pace, this project is set to be completed on-time.
