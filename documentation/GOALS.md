# GOALS
---
### Deliverables
- Using a dataset containing wikipedia articles and their connecting hyperlinks, develop a graph data structure to represent these articles and link relationships
- Develop a functioning project MVP that:
  - Reads in a file containing wiki articles and their links (.tsv?)
  - Develop a directed graph with said dataset
  - Implement several graph algorithms appropriately
    - Of which one purpose is to provide the best path for the ["wikipedia game"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game).
  - Provide an easy to digest and utilize final product
  
### Algorithms & Traversals
- Traversal: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Covered Algorithm: Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest path)
- Complex/Uncoverd: PageRank

### Implementations
- Proper class/object/function decomposition where reasonable, such as:
  - Appropriate class and design structure
  - Abstraction & Encapsulation of algorithms and traversals
  - Operation overloads for Matrix operations (PageRank)
- Functioning makefile usable on EWS system
  - Possibility to provide different `make` arguments to produce different executables
- Practice good programming paradigms
  - Appropriate comments and readable code
  - Efficient algorithm implementations
  - Effective and frequent git usage
